# Python practice notebooks

The Internet is full of cool free Python resources! In this repository, I'll be learning algorithms, recording my solutions to some free practice problems, and taking notes on some free Python articles and books.

In this repository, I am using `pipenv` for dependency and environment management. Just install pipenv, run `pipenv install` from the project root, and run `pipenv shell` to activate the environment. When running a Jupyter notebook, you should use the environment created by `pipenv` as your kernel.

Practice problems come from the following sources:

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Interesting practice problem set that scales in difficulty; not very gamified
- [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) - Highly gamified and a lot of fun, but get very difficult very quickly!

Book notes come from the following resources:

- [Dive into Python3](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/), by Mark Pilgrim
- [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), by Allen B. Downey

Algorithms practice is based on tutorials from various sources, including:

- [GeeksforGeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

This repository also includes notes on documentation for Python libraries and frameworks, including:

- [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/overview/)

Many thanks to the authors who have generously made these resources available online.

You can also find me on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/chriscarrollsmith), where I practice Python along with several other languages:
