For example, if `a` and `b` both equal 1, they will have the same [id](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_id.asp). If I change the value of one of these variables (e.g., `a += 1`), I'm not actually modifying the object it pointed to; that object is immutable and cannot be changed. Rather, I'm telling the variable that it now points to a new/different immutable object at a different memory address."

    "- **Mutable** objects are more complicated, however. Since these mutable objects might be very large, Python generally prefers to change them \"in place\"—by tweaking the object at the original memory address—rather than by creating an entire new modified copy of the object at a new address, as we would with an immutable object. For the same reason, Python's default behavior is to pass them \"by reference\" in assignment operations, function calls, and function return statements. In other words, a variable passed to the function from the parent scope, the variable inside the function, and the variable returned from the function will all point to the same object in memory. A consequence of this handling of mutable objects is that *in-place changes made to a mutable object inside a function also affect the object in the parent scope* (since they both point to the same memory address)."
