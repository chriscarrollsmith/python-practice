    "### General basic points about Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whitespace is important\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python uses white space rather than delimiters to indicate code structure, so indentation is really important. A nice side-effect of this is it enforces readability.\n",
    "- An indent can be any number of spaces, but indentation must be consistent. Blank lines are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is loosely typed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is loosely typed. Function definitions don't declare argument or return types, though they may give non-binding and unenforced type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables are initialized when you assign to them\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike some languages, Python doesn't make you declare a variable before assigning to it. It does this automatically upon assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Every function returns a value\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some languages distinguish functions (which return a value) from subroutines (which do not). This distinction doesn't exist in Python; all functions start with `def`.\n",
    "- Every Python function returns a value. If there's no `return` statement, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments can be required or optional\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a function argument optional, you assign a default value. Required arguments must be declared before optional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Docstrings are non-binding but very helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docstrings, which explain function usage, are non-binding but made available by Python at runtime and are typically displayed by IDEs as a tooltip.\n",
    "- Triple quotes signify a multi-line string. Everything in the quotes is part of the string, including white space and carriage returns. They are commonly used for docstrings because they allow use of unescaped single and double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call functions with keyword or non-keyword args\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can call a function with non-keyword arguments (in sequence), or with keyword arguments (which are sequence-agnostic). You can also mix and match, but non-keyword arguments must precede keyword arguments in the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Everything in Python is a first-class object (can have attributes or methods and be assigned to a variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything in Python, including a function, is an object. All objects have attributes which are available at runtime. For instance, a function's docstring can be accessed like this: `approximate_size.__doc__`. (All functions have this built-in attribute.)\n",
    "- Once you import a module, like `import module`, you can access any of its *public* functions, classes, or attributes, with a period and a name: `module.function`.\n",
    "- Python defines objects loosely. Objects don't *have* to have attributes or methods, and not all objects are subclassable. \n",
    "- All Python objects, including modules, functions, classes, and class instances, can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument. (In programming parlance, all Python objects are \"first-class objects.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python 'raises' 'exceptions' that must be 'handled'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors in Python are called 'exceptions' and triggered with the `raise` keyword (rather than 'throw' as in other languages). If a raised exception is 'unhandled', the program will stop.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, Python functions don't declare what exceptions they might raise, so you have to figure this out yourself.\n",
    "- Exception handling is done with `try...except` rather than 'catch' as in other languages.\n",
    "- Exceptions are implemented as classes, and raising an exception creates an instance of that class.\n",
    "- Exceptions can be handled at any level of the 'stack' of nested functions or classes in which they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import search in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you import something in Python, it checks all directories in sys.path. By default, this basically contains your current workspace folder, your Python executable folder, and any active virtual environment folder.\n",
    "- Import search will return `.py` files on the search path or standard library modules, which are written in C and don't have corresponding `.py` files.\n",
    "- **You can easily insert a new folder into sys.path with `sys.path.insert(0, '/dir/to/add')`.** This persists only until you quit Python (or stop the kernel). You typically want to insert a new path into first position in the list, so your modules will override any modules of the same name that turn up further down the list. **This trick is useful for testing code with older versions of dependency libraries.**"

    "- There are many different encoding schemes, such as different schemes for different languages\n",
    "- If you look at a page that combines two different encoding schemes, you might see two characters that look identical but are encoded differently in memory\n",

    "\n",
    "### A brief history of encoding schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each language has its own encoding scheme, using the numbers 0-255 (because one byte—eight bits—can store numbers up to `2**8-1 == 255`)\n",
    "- English text historically used ASCII, which stores English characters as numbers from 0-127\n",
    "- Western European languages with diacritical marks used CP-1252 (a.k.a. windows-1252), which overlaps with ASCII for the numbers 0-127 but differs at higher numbers\n",
    "- Japanese, Chinese, and Korean have so many characters that they had to use two bytes, permitting the use of numbers ranging from 0-65535 (because `2**16-1 == 65535`)\n",
    "- Word processors developed their own encoding schemes to carry \"rich text\" information that allowed for a wider range of characters\n",
    "- The advent of email and the Internet necessitated protocols for transmitting descryption keys along with text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode: a universal standard\n",

    "- Unicode was an attempt to introduce a universal encoding standard that could work across all languages\n",
    "- The first 127 Unicode characters match ASCII and CP-1252\n",
    "- It used 4 bytes for every character, and thus is known as UTF-32 (because there are 32 bits in 4 bytes)\n",
    "- The advantage of UTF-32 is that you can find the nth character in constant time, because the nth character is the n*4th byte\n",
    "- The disadvantage is that this is a pretty inefficient use of disk space, since most people will almost never need the upper range of that encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UTF-16\n",
    "\n",
    "- UTF-16 uses two bytes, and then does some hacky transformation to convert to UTF-32 when needed (basically trading off some CPU cycles for memory efficiency)\n",
    "- With UTF-16, you can no longer really find the nth character in constant time unless you maintain a separate index\n",
    "- Different computer systems store bytes in different order, so multi-byte encodings like UTF-16 and UTF-32 use a \"Byte Order Mark\" at the beginning of a document to indicate what order to use\n",
    "- UTF-16 is still pretty memory inefficient, because most text on the Internet (even the HTML tags on Chinese web pages) is in English characters and doesn't need two bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UTF-8: Variable-length encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "- UTF-8 uses variable byte length, so that English characters take one byte, extended Latin characters two bytes, and Chinese characters three bytes\n",
    "- The disadvantage is that finding the next character is an O(n) (linear time) rather than O(1) (constant time) operation\n",

    "- You can use empty curly braces (`{}`) and let Python infer the integer indices from the sequence\n",
    "- It's possible to subset the placeholder with an attribute or integer (e.g., `0.st_size` `0[0]`), but not with a non-integer dictionary key, a class method like `pop()`, or even an integer stored in a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion flags and format specifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use a format specifier to right- or center-align text, add leading zeros, sign a number, pad with spaces, control decimal precision, convert to hexadecimal, etc.\n",

    "  - `!s` converts an object to a string, whereas `!r` returns a string that would initialize the object if evaluated as code\n",
    "  - `:+` will sign both positive and negative numbers, while `:-` will sign only negative numbers \n",
    "  - `:,` will add commas to a number as thousands separators\n",
    "  - `:f` formats a number as a decimal fixed point number, while `:g` will use either a fixed-point decimal or scientific notation where appropriate\n",
    "  - `:%` formats the number as a percentage\n",

    "\n",
    "The Python string methods, such as `index`, `find`, `split`, `count`, and `replace`, are limited to searching for static substrings. For more complex search cases, there's regex. All functionality related to regex is located in the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regex basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Important special match characters in regex include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `^`: beginning of string\n",
    "- `$`: end of string\n",
    "- `\\b`: word boundary\n",
    "- `\\s`: space\n",
    "- `\\t`: tab\n",
    "- `\\d`: digit\n",
    "- `\\D`: non-numeric character\n",
    "- `.`: any character\n",
    "- `\\w`: any word\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also modifiers that adjust the preceding character:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x*`: x zero or more times\n",
    "- `x+`: x one or more times\n",
    "- `x{n,m}`: x between n and m times\n",
    "- `x|y`: exactly one of x or y\n",
    "- `x?`: optionally x\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are \"lookahead\" and \"lookbehind\" methods for finding or excluding patterns that occur together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x(?=y)`: x followed by y (positive lookahead)\n",
    "- `x(?!y)`: x not followed by y (negative lookahead)\n",
    "- `(?<=y)x`: x preceded by y (positive lookbehind)\n",
    "- `(?<!y)x`: x not preceded by y (negative lookbehind)\n",
    "- Note that a limitation of negative lookbehinds in Python is that they must be of fixed character length, so `(?<!ab|c)x` won't work because the lookbehind has variable length of either 1 or 2. But you can combine negative lookbehinds of different lengths like `(?:(?<!ab)(?<!c))x`\n",
    "\n",
    "A backslash in Python must be escaped with another backslash (e.g., `\\\\b`) *unless* you precede the string with the letter `r` to tell Python to treat it as a raw string (e.g., `r\"\\b\"` is equivalent to `\"\\\\b\"`). It's good practice to *always* use raw strings when doing regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that regex matching is \"greedy\", meaning it will try to return the largest possible match for a given pattern. Thus, `x+` will return a single match for the string 'xxx', even though several smaller matches are possible (e.g., the first 'x' would match the pattern all by itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with `re` methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `compile()` method compiles your regex pattern so you can use it multiple times throughout your code without having it recompiled under the hood on every use\n",
    "- The `sub()` method takes three arguments: the pattern, a replacement for the pattern, and the string in which to perform the replacement\n",
    "- `sub()` will replace *every* occurrence of the pattern in the string\n",
    "- The `search()` method takes a pattern to match and a string to match against, and returns either `None` or an object of the `Match` class\n",
    "- `search()` returns only the **first** match in the string\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can add the `re.IGNORECASE` flag as an extra argument in any of these methods for case-insensitive matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with `Match` object methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Match` class has methods that describe the matches found:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `span()` returns a tuple containing the start and end positions of the match\n",
    "- `groups()` returns the part of the string where there was a match\n",
    "- If you call `groups()` on a `NoneType` result, it will raise an `AttributeError` you'll need to catch"
