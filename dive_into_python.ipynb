    "### General basic points about Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whitespace is important\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python uses white space rather than delimiters to indicate code structure, so indentation is really important. A nice side-effect of this is it enforces readability.\n",
    "- An indent can be any number of spaces, but indentation must be consistent. Blank lines are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is loosely typed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is loosely typed. Function definitions don't declare argument or return types, though they may give non-binding and unenforced type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables are initialized when you assign to them\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike some languages, Python doesn't make you declare a variable before assigning to it. It does this automatically upon assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Every function returns a value\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some languages distinguish functions (which return a value) from subroutines (which do not). This distinction doesn't exist in Python; all functions start with `def`.\n",
    "- Every Python function returns a value. If there's no `return` statement, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments can be required or optional\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a function argument optional, you assign a default value. Required arguments must be declared before optional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Docstrings are non-binding but very helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docstrings, which explain function usage, are non-binding but made available by Python at runtime and are typically displayed by IDEs as a tooltip.\n",
    "- Triple quotes signify a multi-line string. Everything in the quotes is part of the string, including white space and carriage returns. They are commonly used for docstrings because they allow use of unescaped single and double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call functions with keyword or non-keyword args\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can call a function with non-keyword arguments (in sequence), or with keyword arguments (which are sequence-agnostic). You can also mix and match, but non-keyword arguments must precede keyword arguments in the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Everything in Python is a first-class object (can have attributes or methods and be assigned to a variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything in Python, including a function, is an object. All objects have attributes which are available at runtime. For instance, a function's docstring can be accessed like this: `approximate_size.__doc__`. (All functions have this built-in attribute.)\n",
    "- Once you import a module, like `import module`, you can access any of its *public* functions, classes, or attributes, with a period and a name: `module.function`.\n",
    "- Python defines objects loosely. Objects don't *have* to have attributes or methods, and not all objects are subclassable. \n",
    "- All Python objects, including modules, functions, classes, and class instances, can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument. (In programming parlance, all Python objects are \"first-class objects.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python 'raises' 'exceptions' that must be 'handled'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors in Python are called 'exceptions' and triggered with the `raise` keyword (rather than 'throw' as in other languages). If a raised exception is 'unhandled', the program will stop.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, Python functions don't declare what exceptions they might raise, so you have to figure this out yourself.\n",
    "- Exception handling is done with `try...except` rather than 'catch' as in other languages.\n",
    "- Exceptions are implemented as classes, and raising an exception creates an instance of that class.\n",
    "- Exceptions can be handled at any level of the 'stack' of nested functions or classes in which they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import search in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you import something in Python, it checks all directories in sys.path. By default, this basically contains your current workspace folder, your Python executable folder, and any active virtual environment folder.\n",
    "- Import search will return `.py` files on the search path or standard library modules, which are written in C and don't have corresponding `.py` files.\n",
    "- **You can easily insert a new folder into sys.path with `sys.path.insert(0, '/dir/to/add')`.** This persists only until you quit Python (or stop the kernel). You typically want to insert a new path into first position in the list, so your modules will override any modules of the same name that turn up further down the list. **This trick is useful for testing code with older versions of dependency libraries.**"
